Hello, we are Anastasia and Ria and we created a game similar to Wordle but with our own twist called *insert title here*

Description:
The user will have three lives, and those will correspond with three mystery letters that are not in the word they are trying to guess. If the user guesses one of those letters they lose a life. The game ends when they guess the word (win), don’t guess the word in the amount of tries they have (lose), or if they run out of lives (lose). Also, the theme of the game is Disney Pixar’s Inside Out.
